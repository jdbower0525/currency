The purpose of these programs is to test the use of multiple modules in a program, as well as writing test functions for the program.

Use of this program requires pulling up the nosetest program and checking to make sure all of the tests for the programs
currency.py and currency_converter.py are functioning properly.  Adding new currency codes and changing ratios would need to be done
in the master programs.  As understanding of classes and pulling dictionary values to test against gets better, these kinds
of programs will get a little more user friendly.
